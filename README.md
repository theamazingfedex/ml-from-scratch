# ml-from-scratch

I learned how to make a neural network in python, from scratch. This is my implementation of some of the most basic features of machine learning. I will probably expand on this, and make optimizations and branches along the way so that we can see the optimizations happen.

It's not perfect, but there's also an ipython/Jupyter notebook in here for people to learn along with. It is currently unfinished, but I'll add to it as I get the time.

##### Don't forget to check out the other branches of this repository to see more optimal solutions!
