# ml-from-scratch

I learned how to make a neural network in python, from scratch. This is my implementation of some of the most basic features of machine learning. I will probably expand on this, and make optimizations and branches along the way so that we can see the optimizations happen.

It's not perfect, but there's also an ipython/Jupyter notebook in here for people to learn along with. It is currently unfinished, but I'll add to it as I get the time.
##### The current version uses mini-batch gradient descent to optimize the calculation of loss for large datasets. When there is a lot of data, it doesn't make sense to compute the full loss function over the entire training set when you only want to update a single parameter.
